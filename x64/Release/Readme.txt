Air Mouse (v3.2.0)


------------------------------
	Installation
------------------------------
No installation is required, the executable is standalone and portable.

Windows will probably show a big scary window saying "Windows protected your PC" the 
first time you run the application;
This is because as a standalone developer I cannot afford the ridiculous 
$(400 - 700) per year cost for a digital certificate.

Just click on 'More info' and 'Run anyway'

If application is not run as 'Administrator', it will lose control over elevated 
processes such as 'Task Manager' but should work fine otherwise

Ensure the PC on the same network as the Android device

Ensure Firewall isn't blocking the application



-------------------------------
	Compatibility
-------------------------------
This version should be compatible with Android app version 3.2.X
